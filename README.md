# Breast-Cancer-Classification

Introduction
Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society.

Objectives
This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this i have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.


Here , I have used 3 classification alogirthms and the accuracy of the each model


I have used Classification Accuracy method to find the accuracy of the models. Classification Accuracy is what we usually mean, when we use the term accuracy. It is the ratio of number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples.

After applying the different classification models, we have got below accuracies with different models:

1.Logistic Regression - 98.8%
2.Decision Tree - 94.4%
3.Random Forest -97.8%

Random forest classification algorithm gives the best result for this dataset
